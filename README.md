For my Master thesis **Security in Decentralized Finance: Smart Contract Security**,in MSc Blockchain and Digital Currency in University Of Nicosia, due to the impracticality of including entire smart contracts and Defi applications within the master thesis, which are of extensive length, a GitHub repository has been created to host all materials related to this master thesis, including:
* Vulnerable Smart Contracts that have been created specifically for this master thesis,
*	Attacking smart contracts have been developed to conduct attacks, completing challenges mentioned on this master thesis.
* The Smart Contract Auditing framework that has been designed on this master thesis.
In all common attacking vulnerability scenarios or the discusses interfaces, each smart contract is linked on GitHub for an easier navigation.


## Security Awareness Video Series for the Hellenic speaking community
In an effort to improve the understanding and knowledge of Blockchain and Smart Contract Security among Greek speaking communities, particularly those based in Greece and Cyprus, on this master thesis we have developed a comprehensive course focused on Smart Contract Security and Auditing. This series consists of 18 episodes presented in Greek language, using several tools and exploiting step by step smart contracts, demonstrating how vulnerabilities can be exploited and the associated risks with Blockchain based technologies. The series will be available on both YouTube and LBRY in TuxHouse Educational channel.
The episodes will be uploaded regularly over the next few months and will be publicly accessible on both platforms.

The episodes of these series are these:
1.	Creating a Testnet wallet with Metamask
2.	An Introduction to Remix â€“ Ethereum IDE
3.	Creating a basic Solidity written Hello World smart contract
4.	War Of Array
5.	Fallout
6.	Access Control (Simple Bridge)
7.	Vault
8.	Force
9.	Tx.Origin vs msg.sender
10.	DelegateCall
11.	Basic Vulnerable Token (University Token)
12.	Remix IDE extensions and Cookbook.dev
13.	Creating a secure ERC20 token
14.	Locked ERC20 Tokens with NaughtCoin
15.	Reentrancy Attacks
16.	Ethereum Sec Toolbox Container installation in Docker and Podman
17.	Static Analysis Tools - Slither
18.	Using AI for Static Analysis
