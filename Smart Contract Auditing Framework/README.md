This Smart Contract Security and Maturity Assessment Framework is designed to bridge the gap between the traditional information security standards and the unique challenges presented in the Blockchain World. Thus, being inspired by established standards such as ISO 27001, NIST and even Hellenic’s Republic Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool, this framework adapts and extends the industry’s best practices to meet the specific needs of smart contracts and Defi platforms.
Αs we have realized, from the above detail explanations from the common vulnerabilities, analysis, in the rapidly evolving world of Decentralized Finance, and most especially the security and integrity of smart contracts are of high importance.
The framework follows the structure of Smart Contract Security Verification Standard however it places greater emphasis on promoting transparency and strong business logic on the smart contract, including controls for event logs, monitoring, incident response and how the governance is structured in smart contracts or Defi platforms.
This framework is structured around 11 key categories representing the lifecycle and operational aspects of smart contracts, extending to entire Defi platforms and companies that are supporting them. The main aspect of this framework is to establish trust and transparency in smart contracts by including policies, procedures, data flows, charts and all elements explaining the operation and governance of smart contracts. Subsequently, it prioritizes the security of code under development and maintenance, focusing on upgrades and vulnerability patch management. As Defi platforms practically consist of multiple intercommunicating smart contracts, the controls are trying to describe multiple concepts. For this reason, the final controls in this framework specifically address Defi platforms or multiple smart contracts, as well as about how the developers of the smart contract, monitoring, managing risk and the design of incident response plans for potential issues.
Therefore, many controls are not applicable to all circumstances. The more critical the smart contracts being developed is, the more critical measures must be implemented in order to promote transparency and enhanced security. 
Controls that must be applied in any circumstances are indicated in the “Implementation Status” with only the options of Yes/No.
Criticality levels are determined based on the potential impact of a control’s failure on the security and operation of a smart contract. Factors include the likelihood of exploitation, the potential for financial loss, and the impact on user and stakeholder’s trust. However, considering the immutable nature of Blockchain Networks and smart contracts, changes are more challenging than in the traditional information systems. Consequently, in reality, the criticality is significantly higher for all levels than in conventional systems.
The categories that are being used on this framework are the following:
1.	Policies, Procedures and Documentation: These controls establish security and ensure transparency in terms of governance,
2.	Smart Contract Development: These controls focus on secure coding practices, peer reviews and auditing processes (formally or internally) to minimize vulnerabilities in smart contracts deployed in production (public or private Blockchains),
3.	Access Control and Authorization: These controls ensure that only authorized actions are possible, based on defined polices,
4.	Upgrades and Vulnerability Patches: These controls manage changes and improvements securely, ensuring minimal disruption and risk,
5.	Security Awareness and Training: Equipping developers with knowledge about new vulnerabilities, threads and new attacks and exploits, enabling them to recognize and mitigate incidents,
6.	Cryptography, Privacy and Randomness: Protecting data integrity and confidentiality of data stored both on-chain and off-chain,
7.	Compliance and Legal: Addressing regulatory requirements and legal considerations for global operations as well as for getting certifications from reputable companies,
8.	Risk Assessment: Identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities and threads,
9.	Monitoring: Continuously monitoring smart contract operations and transactions to detect and response to unnormal behaviors,
10.	Incident Response and Recovery: Preparing for managing security incidents to minimize the impact and restore operations,
11.	Financial Security: Special controls designed for Defi applications and platforms to protect against economic attacks and ensure the financial stability of the Defi platforms.
